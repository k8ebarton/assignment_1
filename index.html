	<p>Well now, hold on 
	<p>maybe I won't go to sleep at all 
	<p>and it'll be a beautiful white night
	<p>or else I'll collapse
	<p>completely from nerves and be calm
	<p>as a rug or a bottle of pills
	<p>or <a href="poem2.html">suddenly</a> I'll be off Montauk
	<p>swimming and loving it and not caring where</p>
