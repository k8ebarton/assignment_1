	<p>at the Rond-Point they were eating 
	<p>an oyster, but here 
	<p>we were dropping by sculptures 
	<p>and seeing some paintings
	<p>and the smasheroo-grates of Cadoret 
	<p>and music by Varése, too 
	<p>well Adolf Gottlieb <a href="file:///Users/katherinebarton/Desktop/desktop/parsons/fall_2018/web_design/git-hub/assignment_1/poem4.html">I guess</a> you 
	<p>are the hero of this day 
	<p>along with venison and Bill 
	<p>
	<p>I’ll sleep on the yoghurt and dream of the Persian Gulf</p>
