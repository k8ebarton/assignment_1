	<p>at the Rond-Point they were eating 
	<p>an oyster, but here 
	<p>we were dropping by sculptures 
	<p>and seeing some paintings
	<p>and the smasheroo-grates of Cadoret 
	<p>and music by Varése, too 
	<p>well Adolf Gottlieb I guess you 
	<p>are the hero of this day 
	<p>along with venison and Bill
