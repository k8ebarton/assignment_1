	<p>an invitation to lunch
	<p>HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
	<p>when I only have 16 cents and 2
	<p>packages of yoghurt
	<p>there's <a href="/poem3.html">a lesson</a> in that, isn't there
	<p>like in Chinese poetry when a leaf falls?
	<p>hold off on the yoghurt till the very
	<p>last, when everything may improve</p>
